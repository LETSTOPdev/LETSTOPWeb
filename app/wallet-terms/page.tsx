                to these Terms of Use (the "Terms"). Please read them carefully before accessing or using the Wallet. If
                you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use the Wallet.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-300">
                By using the Wallet, and thus, accepting these Terms, the User does not rely on any representation,
                warranty or other provision except as expressly provided in these Terms and all conditions, warranties
                or other terms and any implied law are hereby excluded to the fullest extent permitted by law.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-300">
                By creating a Wallet within the App, you acknowledge and agree to be bound by these Terms of Use, the
                general terms applicable to the App, and our Privacy Policy. The Wallet is designed for use by
                individuals over the age of 18.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">2. SCOPE OF WALLET SERVICES</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-300">
                2.1. The Wallet provides functionalities for managing and storing supported $STOP cryptographic tokens
                (the "Tokens"). It enables you to:
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-300">2.1.1. Store, send, and receive Tokens.</p>
              <p className="text-gray-300">2.1.2. View balances and transaction history.</p>
              <p className="text-gray-300">
                2.2. LETSTOP does not hold, control, or have access to your Tokens or private keys. The Wallet operates
                as a non-custodial wallet, meaning you have sole responsibility for managing your Tokens and private
                keys.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">3. ACCOUNT CREATION & SECURITY</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-300">3.1. Account Creation:</p>
              <p className="text-gray-300">
                To use the Wallet, you may be required to create an account within the App and agree to additional
                terms, e.g. two-factor authentication and PIN code creation or any other security manner we may
                implement for the protection of our Users and systems.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-300">3.2. Private Keys and Backup:</p>
              <p className="text-gray-300">
                You are solely responsible for securely storing your private keys, backup phrases, and any other
                security-related credentials associated with the Wallet. Loss of private keys or backup phrases may
                result in the irreversible loss of your Tokens.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-300">3.3. Security Practices:</p>
              <p className="text-gray-300">
                You agree to take all necessary measures to maintain the security of your Wallet, including keeping your
                device secure, safeguarding your PIN code and credentials, and avoiding sharing any sensitive
                information.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">4. USER RESPONSIBILITIES; WALLET LIMITATIONS</h2>

              <p className="text-gray-300">
                4.1. LETSTOP does not provide custodial services for your Wallet or Tokens. Any loss or theft resulting
                from misuse, hacking, phishing, or loss of private keys is your sole responsibility.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-300">
                4.2. You are responsible for complying with applicable laws and regulations related to your use of the
                Wallet, including tax obligations.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-300">
                4.3. You may not use the Wallet for any unlawful activities, including but not limited to money
                laundering, fraud, or terrorism financing.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-300">
                4.4. The Wallet may only support the Tokens. LETSTOP does not guarantee the compatibility of any digital
                Tokens with the Wallet other than the Tokens.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-300">
                4.5. Some features of the Wallet may rely on third-party services, such as exchanges or payment
                processors. LETSTOP is not responsible for any third-party actions or omissions.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-300">
                Transaction Processing: All transactions are irreversible once they are broadcast to the blockchain.
                LETSTOP has no control over blockchain networks and is not responsible for delayed or failed
                transactions.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">5. TRANSACTION PROCESSING AND FEES</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-300">
                5.1. All transactions are irreversible once they are broadcast to the blockchain. LETSTOP has no control
                over blockchain networks and is not responsible for delayed or failed transactions.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-300">
                5.2. Transactions conducted through the Wallet may require fees paid to the relevant blockchain network.
                LETSTOP does not control these fees and may provide only estimates.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-300">
                5.3. The User shall bear sole responsibility for the any transaction in the Wallet and the addresses
                provided by the User and such addresses' compatibility to the Tokens. In the event that the User
                provides a non-accurate address or an incompatible recipient wallet, this will most likely result in
                Tokens being lost or transferred to a recipient which is not the User or the intended recipient, in
                which case the User understands that the Company will not be deemed liable and will not return the
                Tokens or transfer any additional Tokens.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">6. REPRESENTATION AND WARRANTIES</h2>

                12.2. Any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms is personal to the User and the Company and
                shall be resolved solely through individual arbitration and shall not be brought as a class arbitration,
                class action or any other type of representative proceeding. No class arbitration or arbitration in
                which an individual may attempt to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group
                of individuals shall be possible. Further, a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of
                representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or
                group of individuals.

                enforce obligations under these Terms without the necessity of proving actual damages and without the
                necessity of posting bond or making any undertaking in connection therewith.

                expertise in the subject matter, who shall not be affiliated to any of the Company or the User and shall
                not have a conflict of interests. Such Arbitrator shall be selected jointly by the Company and the User
                or, if the Company and the User are unable to agree within ten (10) days following the date of the
                receipt of the arbitration notice, the Arbitrator shall be selected by the chairman of the Israeli Bar

                authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, provided, however, that the
                arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative or class
                action, which is prohibited by these Terms. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration
                and may not consolidate more than one individual's claims, preside over any type of class or
                representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.

                These Terms shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the state of
                Israel, excluding Israeli choice-of-laws principles. Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or

                from these Terms and the remainder of these Terms shall be interpreted as if such provision were so
                excluded and shall be enforceable in accordance with their terms; provided, however, that in such event
                these Terms shall be interpreted so as to give effect, to the greatest extent consistent with and
                permitted by applicable law, to the meaning and intention of the excluded provision as determined by
                such court of competent jurisdiction.

                specifically set forth in such writing. All remedies, either under these Terms or by law or otherwise

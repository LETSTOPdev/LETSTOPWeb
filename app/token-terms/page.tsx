              <p className="text-gray-300">
                If any term or provision of these Terms is held by an arbitrator or by a court of competent jurisdiction
                (as the case may be) to be unenforceable under applicable law, then such provision shall be excluded
                from these Terms and the remainder of these Terms shall be interpreted as if such provision were so
                excluded and shall be enforceable in accordance with their terms; provided, however, that in such event
                these Terms shall be interpreted so as to give effect, to the greatest extent consistent with and
                permitted by applicable law, to the meaning and intention of the excluded provision as determined by
                such court of competent jurisdiction.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">16. ENTIRE AGREEMENT; AMENDMENTS</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-300">
                These Terms and the Purchase Agreement (if executed with the relevant Holder) constitute the entire
                agreement between the Holder and the Company relating to the purchase of Tokens. The Company may make
                changes to these Terms from time to time as reasonably required to comply with applicable law or
                regulation. In the event that the Company makes such changes, it shall post the amended Terms on its
                website. Such amended Terms shall be effective immediately once made public on the Company's website.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">17. ASSIGNMENT</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-300">
                The Holder may not assign any of the Holder's rights and obligations under these Terms without the
                Company's consent. The Company may assign its rights to any Affiliate thereof.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">18. DELAYS; OMISSIONS</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-300">
                No delay or omission to exercise any right, power, or remedy accruing to the Company upon any breach or
                default of the Holder of these Terms, shall be deemed a waiver of any other breach or default
                theretofore or thereafter occurring. Any waiver, permit, consent, or approval of any kind or character
                on the part of any party of any breach or default under these Terms, or any waiver on the part of any
                party of any provisions or conditions of these Terms, must be in writing and shall be effective only to
                the extent specifically set forth in such writing. All remedies, either under these Terms or by law or
                otherwise afforded to the Company, shall be cumulative and not alternative. The Company shall not be
                liable for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under these Terms where the delay or failure
                results from any cause beyond the Company's reasonable control.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">19. NO PARTNERSHIP OR JOINT VENTURE</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-300">
                Purchasing Tokens from the Company does not create any form of partnership, joint venture or any other
                similar relationship between the Holder and the Company. Except as otherwise provided herein, these
                Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the Holder and the Company and are not intended to confer
                third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity. The Holder agrees and acknowledges that
                all agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that the Company provides, including
                these Terms, shall be provided in electronic form.
              </p>
